# BST: Invert Binary Tree ( ** Interview Question)
# Objective: Write a method to invert (or mirror) a binary tree. This means that for every node in the binary tree, you will swap its left and right children.



# Method Signature:

# def __invert_tree(self, node):



# Input:

# node: A Node object representing the root of a binary tree. The Node class has attributes value, left, and right, where value is the value stored in the node, and left and right are pointers to the node's left and right children, respectively.



# Output:

# The root node of the inverted binary tree.



# Requirements:

# The method must be recursive. It should work by traversing the tree and swapping the left and right children of every node encountered.

# If the input tree is empty (i.e., node is None), the method should return None.

# The inversion should happen in-place, meaning you should not create a new tree but instead modify the existing tree structure.

# The method should handle binary trees of any size and structure, ensuring that every node's left and right children are swapped.

    #   | Description:                                      |
    #   | - Private method to invert a binary tree.         |
    #   | - It swaps every left child with its right child  |
    #   |   recursively.                                    |
    #   |                                                   |
    #   | Parameters:                                       |
    #   | - node: The current node being visited.           |
    #   |                                                   |
    #   | Return:                                           |
    #   | - The node after its subtree has been inverted.   |
    #   |                                                   |
    #   | Tips:                                             |
    #   | - The function works recursively, swapping left   |
    #   |   and right children of all nodes in the tree.    |
    #   | - A temporary variable is used to facilitate the  |
    #   |   swap of the children.                           |

# List: Max Profit ( ** Interview Question)
# You are given a list of integers representing stock prices for a certain company over a period of time, where each element in the list corresponds to the stock price for a specific day.

# You are allowed to buy one share of the stock on one day and sell it on a later day.

# Your task is to write a function called max_profit that takes the list of stock prices as input and returns the maximum profit you can make by buying and selling at the right time.

# Note that you must buy the stock before selling it, and you are allowed to make only one transaction (buy once and sell once).

# Constraints:



# Each element of the input list is a positive integer representing the stock price for a specific day.



# Function signature: def max_profit(prices):

# Example:

# Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
# Function call: profit = max_profit(prices)
# Output: profit = 5

# Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by buying the stock on day 2 (price 1) and selling it on day 5 (price 6), resulting in a profit of 6 - 1 = 5.

# WRITE MAX_PROFIT FUNCTION HERE #
def max_profit(prices):

        elif price - min_price > max_profit:
            max_profit = price - min_price

    return max_profit

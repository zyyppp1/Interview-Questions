# List: Rotate ( ** Interview Question)
# You are given a list of n integers and a non-negative integer k.

# Your task is to write a function called rotate that takes the list of integers and an integer k as input and rotates the list to the right by k steps.

# The function should modify the input list in-place, and you should not return anything.

# Constraints:

# Each element of the input list is an integer.

# The integer k is non-negative.



# Function signature: def rotate(nums, k):

# Example:

# Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 3
# Function call: rotate(nums, k)
# Output: nums = [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]


# Explanation: The list has been rotated to the right by 3 steps:



# [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# [6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# WRITE ROTATE FUNCTION HERE #
def rotate(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    k = k % n
    nums[:] = nums[n-k:] + nums[:n-k]    

# Or:
# def rotate(nums, k):
#     k = k % len(nums)
#     nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
k = 3
rotate(nums, k)
print("Rotated array:", nums)


"""
    EXPECTED OUTPUT:
    ----------------
    Rotated array: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# LL: Find Kth Node From End ( ** Interview Question)
# Implement the find_kth_from_end function, which takes the LinkedList (ll) and an integer k as input, and returns the k-th node from the end of the linked list WITHOUT USING LENGTH.

# Given this LinkedList:

# 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

# If k=1 then return the first node from the end (the last node) which contains the value of 4.

# If k=2 then return the second node from the end which contains the value of 3, etc.

# If the index is out of bounds, the program should return None.

# The find_kth_from_end function should follow these requirements:

# The function should utilize two pointers, slow and fast, initialized to the head of the linked list.

# The fast pointer should move k nodes ahead in the list.

# If the fast pointer becomes None before moving k nodes, the function should return None, as the list is shorter than k nodes.

# The slow and fast pointers should then move forward in the list at the same time until the fast pointer reaches the end of the list.

# The function should return the slow pointer, which will be at the k-th position from the end of the list.



# This is a separate function that is not a method within the LinkedList class. This means you need to indent the function all the way to the LEFT.
